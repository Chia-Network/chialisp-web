# Chialisp

Chialisp is a powerful and secure LISP-like language for encumbering and releasing funds with smart-contract capabilities.
This website is a consolidated place to learn about Chialisp, CLVM and the conditions language.

Here's a sample:
```
(mod (password new_puzhash amount)
  (defconstant CREATE_COIN 51)

  (if (= (sha256 password) (q . 0x2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824))
    (list (list CREATE_COIN new_puzhash amount))
    (x)
  )
)
```

## Coloured Coins

The first Chialisp smart transaction that we integrated into chia-blockchain were Coloured Coins. We will be integrating additional smart transactions and wallets into chia-blockchain in most releases.
