I_n with amounts A_1, ... A_n.\n;\n; We put them in a ring, so \"previous\" and \"next\" have intuitive k-1 and k+1 semantics,\n; wrapping so {n} and 0 are the same, ie. all indices are mod n.\n;\n; Each coin creates 0 or more coins with total output value O_k.\n; Let D_k = the \"debt\" O_k - A_k contribution of coin I_k, ie. how much debt this input accumulates.\n; Some coins may spend more than they contribute and some may spend less, ie. D_k need\n; not be zero. That's okay. It's enough for the total of all D_k in the ring to be 0.\n;\n; A coin can calculate its own D_k since it can verify A_k (it's hashed into the coin id)\n; and it can sum up `CREATE_COIN` conditions for O_k.\n;\n; Defines a \"subtotal of debts\" S_k for each coin as follows:\n;\n; S_1 = 0\n; S_k = S_{k-1} + D_{k-1}\n;\n; Here's the main trick that shows the ring sums to 0.\n; You can prove by induction that S_{k+1} = D_1 + D_2 + ... + D_k.\n; But it's a ring, so S_{n+1} is also S_1, which is 0. So D_1 + D_2 + ... + D_k = 0.\n; So the total debts must be 0, ie. no coins are created or destroyed.\n;\n; Each coin's solution includes I_{k-1}, I_k, and I_{k+1} along with proofs that I_{k}, and I_{k+1} are CATs of the same type.\n; Each coin's solution includes S_{k-1}. It calculates D_k = O_k - A_k, and then S_k = S_{k-1} + D_{k-1}\n;\n; Announcements are used to ensure that each S_k follows the pattern is valid.\n; Announcements automatically commit to their own coin id.\n; Coin I_k creates an announcement that further commits to I_{k-1} and S_{k-1}.\n;\n; Coin I_k gets a proof that I_{k+1} is a cat, so it knows it must also create an announcement\n; when spent. It checks that I_{k+1} creates an announcement committing to I_k and S_k.\n;\n; So S_{k+1} is correct iff S_k is correct.\n;\n; Coins also receive proofs that their neighbours are CATs, ensuring the announcements aren't forgeries.\n; Inner puzzles and the CAT layer prepend `CREATE_COIN_ANNOUNCEMENT` with different prefixes to avoid forgeries.\n; Ring announcements use 0xcb, and inner puzzles are given 0xca\n;\n; In summary, I_k generates a coin_announcement Y_k (\"Y\" for \"yell\") as follows:\n;\n;  Y_k: hash of I_k (automatically), I_{k-1}, S_k\n;\n; Each coin creates an assert_coin_announcement to ensure that the next coin's announcement is as expected:\n;  Y_{k+1} : hash of I_{k+1}, I_k, S_{k+1}\n;\n; TLDR:\n;  I_k : coins\n;  A_k : amount coin k contributes\n;  O_k : amount coin k spend\n;  D_k : difference/delta that coin k incurs (A - O)\n;  S_k : subtotal of debts D_1 + D_2 ... + D_k\n;  Y_k : announcements created by coin k commiting to I_{k-1}, I_k, S_k\n;\n; All conditions go through a \"transformer\" that looks for CREATE_COIN conditions\n; generated by the inner solution, and wraps the puzzle hash ensuring the output is a cat.\n;\n; Three output conditions are prepended to the list of conditions for each I_k:\n;  (ASSERT_MY_ID I_k) to ensure that the passed in value for I_k is correct\n;  (CREATE_COIN_ANNOUNCEMENT I_{k-1} S_k) to create this coin's announcement\n;  (ASSERT_COIN_ANNOUNCEMENT hashed_announcement(Y_{k+1})) to ensure the next coin really is next and\n;     the relative values of S_k and S_{k+1} are correct\n;\n; This is all we need to do to ensure cats exactly balance in the inputs and outputs.\n;\n; Proof:\n;   Consider n, k, I_k values, O_k values, S_k and A_k as above.\n;   For the (CREATE_COIN_ANNOUNCEMENT Y_{k+1}) (created by the next coin)\n;   and (ASSERT_COIN_ANNOUNCEMENT hashed(Y_{k+1})) to match,\n;   we see that I_k can ensure that is has the correct value for S_{k+1}.\n;\n;   By induction, we see that S_{m+1} = sum(i, 1, m) [O_i - A_i] = sum(i, 1, m) O_i - sum(i, 1, m) A_i\n;   So S_{n+1} = sum(i, 1, n) O_i - sum(i, 1, n) A_i. But S_{n+1} is actually S_1 = 0,\n;   so thus sum(i, 1, n) O_i = sum (i, 1, n) A_i, ie. output total equals input total.\n\n;; GLOSSARY:\n;;  MOD_HASH: this code's sha256 tree hash\n;;  TAIL_PROGRAM_HASH: the program that determines if a coin can mint new cats, burn cats, and check if its lineage is valid if its parent is not a CAT\n;;  INNER_PUZZLE: an independent puzzle protecting the coins.
