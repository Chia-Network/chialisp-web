This video is an exercise in using fundamental Chialisp commands to print out the lyrics to the blockchain version of a [classic song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer).

You will learn Chialisp basics, including:
* print
* calling functions
* using modules
* looping over data
* [cons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons)
* building lists
* recursion

Test your understanding of the concepts in the video by printing out the full list of the lyrics of the song. Your result should look similar to:

```bash

(q. "99 full nodes on the net, 99 full nodes on the net. 
Go out of town, your server goes down, 98 full nodes on 
the net." "98 full nodes on the net, 98 full nodes on the 
net. Go out of town, your server goes down, 97 full nodes 
on the net." "97 full nodes on the net, 97 full nodes on 
the net. Go out of town, your server goes down, 96 full 
nodes on the net." [...] "1 full nodes on the net, 1 full 
nodes on the net. Go out of town, your server goes down, 
0 full nodes on the net.")

```
