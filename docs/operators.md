import Runnable from '@site/src/components/Runnable.tsx';

This is a basic description of each operator. If you want tangible examples for how to use them, check out the [Examples page](/examples).

:::note
The operators in the [Modules section](#chialisp-modules), as well as `if`, `qq`, and `unquote` are only part of Chialisp, not the compiled CLVM representation.

Additionally, they do not have an intrinsic cost, since they are compiled to CLVM and not actually executed on their own.

## Arithmetic

| Operator | Format         | Description                                           |

| divmod   | `(divmod A B)` | Calculates quotient and remainder in cons pair.       |

### Negative Division

:::info

In earlier versions of Chia, the `/` operator produced incorrect rounding when
used with negative numbers. It was disabled in a [soft-fork at block height
2,300,000](https://www.chia.net/2022/03/04/divided-we-fork.en.html). It was
enabled again in the hard fork, with correct behavior. It always rounds towards
negative infinity.

## Comparison

| Operator | Format          | Description                                             |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| =        | `(= A B)`       | True if both atoms are equal.                           |
| >        | `(> A B)`       | True if the first atom is greater as a number.          |
| >s       | `(>s A B)`      | True if the first atom is greater as a string of bytes. |
| not      | `(not A)`       | True if the atom is false.                              |
| all      | `(all A B ...)` | True if all of the atoms are non-zero.                  |

## Control Flow

| Operator   | Format       | Description                                                            |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| if         | `(if A B C)` | **Chialisp only** - If A is true, then B, otherwise C. Lazy evaluated. |
| i - _if_   | `(i A B C)`  | If A is true, then B, otherwise C.                                     |
| x - _exit_ | `(x ...)`    | Terminate the program with zero or more values.                        |

### If Operator

:::note
The `if` operator is lazy evaluated. This means that code paths are not evaluated unless they need to be.

Usually this is the intended behavior, but if it isn't, you can use the `i` operator instead.

If you would like to replicate the lazy evaluation of the `if` operator in CLVM, you can wrap the `i` operator like this:

<Runnable flavor='clvm'>

```chialisp
(a (i (q . 1) (q q . 'abc') (q q . 'xyz')) 1)
```

</Runnable>

Essentially, this runs the branch the condition matches as a program (with the current environment). Depending on how much code is executed in each branch, this may be more cost effective than executing both branches.

## Evaluation

| Operator           | Format        | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| qq - _quasi-quote_ | `(qq A)`      | **Chialisp only** - Quote an expression except for anything inside `unquote`. |
| unquote            | `(unquote A)` | **Chialisp only** - Unquote an expression nested within `qq`.                 |
| q - _quote_        | `(q . A)`     | Treats A as a value rather than a program.                                    |
| a - _apply_        | `(a A B)`     | Evaluate value A as a program with value B as its environment.                |
| @ - _environment_  | `(@ A)`       | **Chialisp only** - Access value A from the environment.                      |

### Environment Operator

:::note
The `@` operator acts in a similar fashion to unquoted atoms in CLVM. If `@` is used plainly as a value, its value is the whole environment.

## Softfork

The purpose of the `softfork` operator is to enable the ability to define new CLVM operators without creating a hard fork. For example, suppose we want to add secp256k1 operators like `+s` for adding two points on this ECDSA curve for bitcoin compatibility. We can't just do this in vanilla CLVM, because that would make the program `(+s A B)` return different values before and after the soft fork. So instead, we can hide it under `softfork`.

The syntax is defined as follows:

```chialisp
(softfork cost extension program arguments)
```

- The `cost` must equal the cost of executing the program with the specified arguments, otherwise an exception is raised. The minimum cost of the operator is 140.
- The `extension` is an unsigned (up to 32-bit in size) integer indicating the set of extensions available in the softfork guard.
- The `program` is executed with the specified `arguments`. The output is always either null or termination of the program if it failed.

Here is a CLVM example using the `coinid` operator described in the [CHIP-0011 Operators](#chip-0011-operators) section:

```chialisp
(softfork
  (q . 1265)  ; expected cost (including cost of softfork itself)
  (q . 0)     ; extension 0
  (q a        ; defer execution of if-branches
    (i
      (=
        (coinid
          (q . 0x1234500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)
          (q . 0x6789abcdef000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)
          (q . 123456789)
        )
        (q . 0x69bfe81b052bfc6bd7f3fb9167fec61793175b897c16a35827f947d5cc98e4bc)
      )
      (q . 0) ; if coin ID matches, return 0
      (q x)   ; if coin ID mismatches, raise
    )
    (q . ())) ; environment to apply
  (q . ())    ; environment to softfork
)
```

Pre-softfork, this always passes and returns `()` at a cost of `cost` (or 140, whichever is higher).

Post-softfork, this also returns `()` at a cost of `cost`, but may also fail if the coin id doesn't match. We can't export the result outside the `softfork` boundary, but we can compare it to something inside and raise if it doesn't match.

We take the cost of running the program inside the `softfork` boundary and ensure it exactly matches `cost`, and raise an exception if it's wrong. That way, the program really does have the same cost pre-softfork and post-softfork (or it fails post-softfork).

## [CHIP-0011](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chips/blob/main/CHIPs/chip-0011.md) Operators

:::info
These operators will be usable within the `softfork` operator starting at block height 4,510,000.

At block height 5,496,000, the operators can be used directly as well.
