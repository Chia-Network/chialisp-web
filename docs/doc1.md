CLVM is the compiled, minimal version of ChiaLisp that is used by the Chia network.
The full set of operators is documented [here](https://github.com/Chia-Network/clvm/blob/master/docs/clvm.org)

This guide will cover the basics of the language and act as an introduction to the structure of programs.
You should be able to follow along by running a version of [clvm_tools](https://github.com/Chia-Network/clvm_tools).

## Types

In ChiaLisp everything is either a list or an atom.
Lists take the form of parentheses and each entry in the list is single spaced.

Atoms are either literal binary blobs or variables.
**A program is actually just a list in [polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation).**

There is no distinguishing of variable types in ChiaLisp.
This means that `(100 0x65 0x68656c6c6f)` and `(0x64 101 'hello')` are equivalent lists.
Internally however the blobs can be interpreted in a number of different ways, which we will cover later.

## Math

There are no support for floating point numbers in ChiaLisp, only integers.
Internally integers are interpreted as 256 bit signed integers.

The math operators are `*`, `+`, and `-`.

```lisp
$ brun '(- (q 6) (q 5))' '()'
1

$ brun '(* (q 2) (q 4) (q 5))' '()'
40

$ brun '(+ (q 10) (q 20) (q 30) (q 40))' '()'
100
```

You may have noticed that the multiplication example above takes more than two parameters in the list.
This is because many operators can take a variable number of parameters.
`+` and `*` are commutative so the order of parameters does not matter.
For non-commutative operations, `(- (q 100) (q 30) (q 20) (q 5))` is equivalent to `(- (q 100) (+ (q 30) (q 20) (q 5)))`.
Similarly, `(/ 120 5 4 2)` is equivalent to `(/ 120 (* 5 4 2))`.

There is also support for negative values.

```lisp
$ brun '(- (q 5) (q 7))' '()'
-2


$ brun '(+ (q 3) (q -8))' '()'
-5
```

To use hexadecimal numbers, simply prefix them with `0x`.

```lisp
$ brun '(+ (q 0x000a) (q 0x000b))' '()'
21
```

The final mathematical operator is equal which acts similarly to == in other languages.

```lisp
$ brun '(= (q 5) (q 6))' '()'
()

$ brun '(= (q 5) (q 5))' '()'
1
```

As you can see above this language interprets some data as boolean values.

## Booleans

In this language an empty list `()` evaluate to `False`.
Any other value evaluates to `True`, though internally `True` is represented with `1`.

```lisp
$ brun '(= (q 100) (q 90))'
()

$ brun '(= (q 100) (q 100))'
1
```

The exception to this rule is `0` because `0` is  exactly the same as `()`.

```lisp
$ brun '(= (q 0) (q ()))' '()'
1

$ brun '(+ (q 70) (q ()))' '()'
70
```

## Flow Control

The `i` operator takes the form `(i A B C)` and acts as an if-statement that
evaluates to `B` if `A` is True and `C` otherwise.
```lisp
$ brun '(i (q 0) (q 70) (q 80))' '()'
80

$ brun '(i (q 1) (q 70) (q 80))' '()'
70

$ brun '(i (q 12) (q 70) (q 80))' '()'
70

$ brun '(i (q ()) (q 70) (q 80))' '()'
80
```

 Note that both `B` and `C` are evaluated eagerly, just like all subexpressions.
To defer evaluation until after the condition, `B` and `C` must be quoted (with
`q`), and then evaluated with double parentheses, e.g. `((B))`.

```lisp
$ brun '((i (q 0) (q (x (q 1337) )) (q 1)))'
```

Now seems like a good time to clarify further about lists and programs.

## Lists and Programs

A list is any space-separated, ordered group of one or more elements inside brackets.
For example: `(70 80 90 100)`, `(0xf00dbabe 48 "hello")`, and `(90)` are all valid lists.

Lists can even contain other lists, such as `("list" "list" ("sublist" "sublist" ("sub-sublist")) "list")`.

Programs are a subset of lists which can be evaluated using CLVM.

**In order for a list to be a valid program:**

- **1. The first item in the list must be a valid operator**
- **2. Every item after the first must be a valid program**

This is why literal values and non-program lists *must* be quoted using `q`.

*Note: There is a special case where the first item in a program is also a program, which we will cover in more detail later.*

Programs can contain non-program lists, but they also must be quoted, for example:

```lisp
$ brun '(q (80 90 100))' '()'
(80 90 100)
```

And now that we know we can have programs inside programs we can create programs such as:

```lisp
$ brun '(i (= (q 50) (q 50)) (+ (q 40) (q 30)) (q 20))' '()'
70
```

Programs in ChiaLisp tend to get built in this fashion.
Smaller programs are assembled together to create a larger program.
It is recommended that you create your programs in an editor with brackets matching!

## List Operators

`f` returns the first element in a passed list.

```lisp
$ brun '(f (q (80 90 100)))' '()'
80
```

`r` returns every element in a list except for the first.

```lisp
$ brun '(r (q (80 90 100)))' '()'
(90 100)
```

`c` prepends an element to a list

```lisp
$ brun '(c (q 70) (q (80 90 100)))' '()'
(70 80 90 100)
```

And we can use combinations of these to access or replace any element we want from a list:

```lisp
$ brun '(c (q 100) (r (q (60 110 120))))' '()'
(100 110 120)

$ brun '(f (r (r (q (100 110 120 130 140)))))' '()'
120
```

## Solutions and Environment Variables

Up until now our programs have not had any input or variables, however ChiaLisp does have support for a kind of variable which is passed in through a solution.

It's important to remember that the context for ChiaLisp is for use in locking up coins with a puzzle program.
This means that we need to be able to pass some information to the puzzle.

A solution is a list of values passed to the puzzle.
In the higher level language the solution can be referenced with `a`.
Note the use of `run` below:

```lisp
$ run '(a)' '("this" "is the" "solution")'
("this" "is the" "solution")

$ run '(f (a))' '(80 90 100 110)'
80

$ run '(r (a))' '(80 90 100 110)'
(90 100 110)
```

And remember lists can be nested too.

```lisp
$ run '(f (f (r (a))))' '((70 80) (90 100) (110 120))'
90

$ run '(f (f (r (a))))' '((70 80) ((91 92 93 94 95) 100) (110 120))'
(91 92 93 94 95)
```

These environment variables can be used in combination with all other operators.

```lisp
$ run '(+ (f (a)) (q 5))' '(10)'
15

$ run '(* (f (a)) (f (a)))' '(10)'
100
```

This program checks that the second variable is equal to the square of the first variable.

```lisp
$ run '(= (f (r (a))) (* (f (a)) (f (a))))' '(5 25)'
1

$ run '(= (f (r (a))) (* (f (a)) (f (a))))' '(5 30)'
()
```

## Accessing Environmental Variables Through Integers

In the above examples we were using `run`, calling the higher level language, instead of `brun` for the lower level language.
This is because for the sake of minimalism in the lower level CLVM language, we address the solution with evaluated integers.

Calling `1` accesses the root of the tree and returns the entire solution list.

```lisp
$ brun '1' '("example" "data" "for" "test")'
("example" "data" "for" "test")
```

After that, you can imagine a binary tree of `f` and `r`, where each node is numbered.

```lisp
$ brun '2' '("example" "data" "for" "test")'
"example"

$ brun '3' '("example" "data" "for" "test")'
("data" "for" "test")
```
And this is designed to work when there are lists inside lists too.
```
$ brun '4' '(("deeper" "example") "data" "for" "test")'
"deeper"

$ brun '5' '(("deeper" "example") "data" "for" "test")'
"data"

$ brun '6' '(("deeper" "example") "data" "for" "test")'
("example")
```

And so on.

## End of Part 1
