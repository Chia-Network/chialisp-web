title: Conditions
---

When a coin is spent, its puzzle is executed on the Chialisp Virtual Machine (CLVM). If the program does not fail, it returns a list of conditions. These conditions determine what the outcome of the spend is, and whether or not the spend is valid.

Puzzles have no access to the outside world, or even to blockchain parameters like block height. Therefore, to interact with the outside environment, they return a list of conditions, each of which must be valid in order for the spend itself to be valid.

There are two kinds of conditions. Some require something to be true (such as time passing) in order for the spend to be valid. And others cause something to happen if the spend is valid (such as the creation of new coins).

## Condition List {#list}

:::warning

Be vigilant when using `ASSERT_MY_COIN_ID` as a shortcut for validating the parent coin ID, puzzle hash, and amount. If they are passed into the solution separately, then validated all at once by hashing them together, it is possible to shift the bytes to the left or right and manipulate the values.

You are recommended to use the `coinid` operator when computing coin IDs. This operator was introduced with [CHIP-11](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chips/blob/main/CHIPs/chip-0011.md). It verifies that hashes are indeed 32 bytes in length, at no extra CLVM cost versus verifying the parent ID, puzzle hash, and amount individually. The `coinid` operator, as well as the other CHIP-11 operators, are described on the [operators page](/operators#chip-0011-operators).

:::warning

While `ASSERT_COIN_ANNOUNCEMENT` and `ASSERT_PUZZLE_ANNOUNCEMENT` will continue to be supported, they are no longer recommended. Instead, you should consider using the [SEND_MESSAGE](#66-send_message) and [RECEIVE_MESSAGE](#67-receive_message) conditions.

When you do need to use `ASSERT_COIN_ANNOUNCEMENT` and `ASSERT_PUZZLE_ANNOUNCEMENT` (for example, when spending coins that were created prior to the existence of `SEND_MESSAGE` and `RECEIVE_MESSAGE`), typically you should only use the conditions in a puzzle's _solution_, and not in the puzzle itself. This is especially important when using `ASSERT_COIN_ANNOUNCEMENT`, because it refers to a specific coin.

To illustrate the danger, let's say `coin A` uses this condition in its puzzle, and it asserts a coin announcement from `coin B`.
In this case, `coin A` requires `coin B` to be spent in the same block as it is spent.
If `coin B` is spent before `coin A`, then `coin A` can _never_ be spent.

However, if this condition is instead used in the _solution_ for `coin A`, and `coin B` has already been spent, then `coin A` can still be spent later, albeit with a different solution.

It is somewhat less dangerous to use `ASSERT_PUZZLE_ANNOUNCEMENT` in a coin's puzzle because it only relies on a coin with a specific puzzle, and many such coins might exist.
However, it is still best practice to only use this condition in a coin's solution.

### About MESSAGE conditions' `mode` parameter

The [SEND_MESSAGE](#66-send_message) and [RECEIVE_MESSAGE](#67-receive_message) conditions require a 1-byte `mode` parameter to commit to the sender and receiver of the message. This parameter is a bitmask of three bits for the sender, and three bits for the receiver. Only the lowest six bits are used (the highest two bits are unused).

Each bit represents whether an attribute from the coin is required (`1`) or not (`0`):

- The first bit represents the parent coin.
- The second bit represents the puzzle hash of the coin.
- The third bit represents the amount (value) of the coin.

The sender and receiver bits each use the following convention:

| Type          | Bits | Parent | Puzzle | Amount |
| :------------ | :--- | :----- | :----- | :----- |
| Coin          | 111  | True   | True   | True   |
| Parent        | 100  | True   | False  | False  |
| Puzzle        | 010  | False  | True   | False  |
| Amount        | 001  | False  | False  | True   |
| Parent-Puzzle | 110  | True   | True   | False  |
| Parent-Amount | 101  | True   | False  | True   |
| Puzzle-Amount | 011  | False  | True   | True   |
| None          | 000  | False  | False  | False  |

The eight conditions from this table apply to both the sender and receiver coins. Therefore, there are 64 possible combinations (8 \* 8). For example, if a specific coin sends a message, and a coin with a specific parent coin and puzzle hash receives it, the bitmask would be `111` concatenated with `110`, or `111110`.

Additional parameters will depend on these six bits. This enables a coin that can send a message to another coin based on a parent/puzzle/amount combination of that destination coin. The recipient coin can receive that message if it also specifies which coin sent it.

Note 1: The `mode` parameter must be identical for both the `SEND_MESSAGE` and the corresponding `RECEIVE_MESSAGE`. In the above example, the sender's `mode` parameter was `111110`. In this case, the receiver's mode parameter must also be `111110` in order for the spend to succeed.

Note 2: The consensus and the mempool will each allow any of the eight possible combinations from the above table.

### About MESSAGE conditions' `varargs` parameter

The [SEND_MESSAGE](#66-send_message) and [RECEIVE_MESSAGE](#67-receive_message) conditions include a varargs (`...`) parameter. This parameter is required for asserting the parent coin ID, puzzle hash, and/or amount of the coin that sent or received the message, depending on the condition:

- When using `SEND_MESSAGE`, the `...` parameter refers to the coin that will receive the message.
- When using `RECEIVE_MESSAGE`, the `...` parameter refers to the coin that sent the message.

The length of this parameter depends on `mode`. Continuing with the table from the previous section, the following arguments are required in the `...` parameter:

| Type          | Bits | Arguments required in `...`        |
| :------------ | :--- | :--------------------------------- |
| Coin          | 111  | `<coin ID>`                        |
| Parent        | 100  | `<parent coin ID>`                 |
| Puzzle        | 010  | `<puzzle hash>`                    |
| Amount        | 001  | `<amount>`                         |
| Parent-Puzzle | 110  | `<parent coin ID>` `<puzzle hash>` |
| Parent-Amount | 101  | `<parent coin ID>` `<amount>`      |
| Puzzle-Amount | 011  | `<puzzle hash>` `<amount>`         |
| None          | 000  | Not used                           |

Note that when all three bits are set, the `coin ID` will be passed instead of its components parts.

:::info
This condition is part of [CHIP-0011](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chips/blob/main/CHIPs/chip-0011.md), and will be available at block height 5,496,000.
:::

:::note
This condition adds an additional [CLVM cost](https://docs.chia.net/coin-set-costs/) equal to whatever the value of the first argument is.

Format: `(90 cost ...args)`

Allows future conditions with non-zero CLVM costs to be added as soft forks. This functionality was previously only possible as a hard fork.

The cost of the condition is specified in ten-thousands, and further arguments are not specified (the soft-forked condition defines these). The reason to scale the cost by 10,000 is to make the argument smaller. For example, a cost of 100 in this condition would equate to an actual cost of 1 million (1,000,000). The cost argument is two bytes, with a maximum size of 65,535 (an actual cost of 655,350,000).

| `...args` | Any          |

## Memos and Hinting {#memos}

When a coin uses one or more outer puzzles that change their puzzle hash, it's challenging for wallets to know which coins they have the ability to spend. The memos field allows you to hint the inner puzzle hash of created coins, which consequently lets the wallet know that the coin belongs to it. Coins can be looked up by the inner puzzle hash rather than the outer puzzle hash.

The `CREATE_COIN` condition is defined as a list containing the opcode `51` and the following arguments:

```chialisp
; The third parameter is optional.
(51 puzzle_hash amount (...memos))
```

The `memos` parameter is an optional list, which must be null terminated.

If `memos` is present, and the first memo is exactly 32 bytes long, it's used as the hint and the rest of the list are memos. Otherwise, values in the entire list are memos.

As an example, the following inner solution for the [standard transaction](/standard-transactions) would create an unhinted coin:

```chialisp
(() (q . ((51 target_puzzle_hash amount))) ())
```

The following solution would instead create a coin with the hint matching the inner puzzle hash:

```chialisp
(() (q . ((51 target_puzzle_hash amount (target_puzzle_hash)))) ())
```

This `CREATE_COIN` condition creates the same coin as before, but now it specifies the hint with which the receiving wallet can look up to find this coin.

Hints are only necessary for outer puzzles, of which the inner puzzle hash matches the hint. For example, coins using the standard transaction itself with no outer puzzle do not need a hint.

## Announcements

Announcements are ephemeral, meaning that they don't last forever. They can only be asserted within the block they are created. Their purpose is to ensure multiple coins are spent together, either for fees, verification, or as a security measure.

For coin announcements, the id is the `coin_id` and `message` sha256 hashed together. Likewise, for puzzle announcements, it's the `puzzle_hash` and `message` sha256 hashed together.
