# Modern chialisp

Chialisp can evolve over time and still serve its role in preserving the
representation of older programs in previous iterations of the language by using
a sigil to indicate what tooling version the program was finalized in. The
current sigil is ```*standard-cl-23*```. Use an 'include' form to set the
tooling version. Chialisp has a lot of new features which make programs easier
to understand, read and write. The speed of its optimizer has been improved to
allow faster iteration and several features make chialisp safer. Undefined
variables are no longer treated as values, and return diagnostics instead. Let
bindings and related assign forms allow programs to be structured more logically
and preprocessing is now a separate pass that can be inspected on its own.

## Description of the new language

### An example of modern chialisp exercising many of the new features:

```chialisp
(mod (X)

  ;; Specify that this program is compiled with *standard-cl-23*.
  ;; After release, the chialisp compiler guarantees that programs
  ;; with a specific sigil (including no sigil) compile to the
  ;; same representation forever (it is a bug that must be fixed
  ;; if a program changes representation in a future compiler
  ;; release).  In this way, program source code can also provide
  ;; enough information to re-produce a puzzle hash from source
  ;; code.
  (include *standard-cl-23*)

  ;; Normal functions are now allowed to be called from macros.
  ;; When run in macro space, they can used special forms to detect
  ;; what language level tokens are given (to differentiate identifiers
  ;; and constants and the like).  Functions can be used both by the
  ;; deployed program and macros or just either.
  (defun n-additions-inner (n value idx)
    (if (> idx n)
      ()
     (qq (c (+ (unquote idx) (unquote value)) (unquote (n-additions-inner n value (+ 1 idx)))))
     )
   )

  ;; The new 'defmac' keyword defines a modern macro.  They're like
  ;; the prior macro system but can't rely on their own definition
  ;; or anything lexically after themselves (like in the C preprocessor).
  ;; You can view the preprocessor expansion of a program before it's
  ;; handed to the compiler proper using the -E switch.
  (defmac n-additions (n value) (n-additions-inner n value 1))

  (defun F (X) (n-additions 3 X))
      
  (defun odd (X) (logand X 1))
      
  ;; Usual higher order functions work like you might hope.
  ;; This filter function takes a predicate, "pred", which
  ;; returns a truthy value to include the result or nil.
  ;; (@ lst (first . rest)) is similar to a similar 
  ;; destructuring form in haskell.
  ;; (@ lst (first . rest))
  ;; generates the same bindings as simultaneously having
  ;; (pred lst)
  ;; and
  ;; (pred (first . rest))
  ;; as an argument list.
  (defun filter (pred (@ lst (first . rest)))
    (if lst
      (if (a pred (list first))
        (c first (filter pred rest))
        (filter pred rest)
        )
      ()
      )
    )
      
  ;; @ destructuring here takes the place of the
  ;; whole argument list.
  (defun sum (@ the-list (first . rest))
    (if the-list
      (+ first (a sum rest))
      0
      )
    )
    
  (assign
    ;; We can destructure the result based on its shape.
    ;; Assign reorders and groups assignments based on their dependencies.
    (A B C) result-list
        
    ;; The bindings can be in any order, like the let forms in elm, haskell
    ;; and others.
    result-list (F X)

    summed (a sum result-list)
    
    ;; We can name 'sum' as a predicate.
    odds (filter odd result-list)

    ;; Result of this form.
    (list summed odds)
    )
  )
```

## Complete list of new features

### defconst constants

The new defconst form has access to the program surrounding it at compile time.
The value that results is computed at compile time (and causes an error if that
isn't possible for some reason, such as it depends on its own constant, causes
a clvm exception or some other problem) and the compiler chooses the smaller
representation of inlining it or placing it in the environment.

```chialisp
(mod (Z)

  (include *standard-cl-23*)

  ; takes a lisp tree and returns the hash of it
  (defun sha256tree1 (TREE)
    (if (l TREE)
      (sha256 2 (sha256tree1 (f TREE)) (sha256tree1 (r TREE)))
      (sha256 1 TREE)
      )
    )

  (defconst HELLO_HASH (sha256tree1 (c "hello" "world")))
    
  (sha256 HELLO_HASH Z)
  )
```
```shell
$ brun defconsthash.clvm '(3)'
0xf60efb25b9e6e3587acd9cf01c332707bb771801bdb5e4f50ea957a29c8dde89
$ opc -H '(hello . world)'
9d1890eef772e63013f481b4313eeaae7de4b0601268f380124ad1d74d694d15
$ brun '(sha256 (q . 0x9d1890eef772e63013f481b4313eeaae7de4b0601268f380124ad1d74d694d15) (q . 3))'
0xf60efb25b9e6e3587acd9cf01c332707bb771801bdb5e4f50ea957a29c8dde89
```

### ```let```, ```let*``` and ```assign``` forms

Chialisp now has local bindings that allow code to be more organized, to use the
same computation more than once without having to explicitly write and call a
separate function to capture the value into a CLVM environment that can be
extracted via variable reference. The bound variables can be referenced in the
body. let and let* forms are classic lisp and scheme, and allow just a name to
be bound from an expression. ```let``` performs all bindings at the same time
(they don't have access to each other) and the other form of let allows each
one to access the values bound before it.  ```assign``` can handle any arrangement
of bindings as long as they don't form a cycle.

```chialisp
(mod (Z)
  
  (include *standard-cl-23*)
  
  (let ((X (+ Z 1))
        (Y (- Z 1)))
    (* X Y)
    )
  )
```
```shell
$ brun simple-let.clvm '(5)'
24
```

### at capture

Chialisp supports overlapping variable bindings in which one gives a name to a
collection of further destructuring.

In haskell, it's possible to bind both a container and its contents:

```haskell
data Pt = Pt Int Int deriving Show
f p@(Pt x y) = if x == 0 then p else Pt (x - 1) y
```

Scheme and lisp argument destructuring can stand in for destructuring objects.
In the above case, we can refer to the object's fields separately and the object
itself if we just want to pass it on whole or return it.

You can also use this to simulate Maybe or Options type in a convenient way.

```haskell
> f p = fromMaybe 0 $ (\(Pt x y) -> x + y) <$> p
> f (Just (Pt 3 5))
8
> f Nothing
0
```

In chialisp:


```chialisp
(mod (p) 
  (include *standard-cl-23*) 
      
  (defun F ((@ p (x y))) (if p (+ x y) 0)) 
      
  (F p)
  )
```
```shell
$ brun maybe.clvm '((3 5))'
8
$ brun maybe.clvm '(())'
0
```

You can also do this with a higher order functions similarly.  In this
implementation, maybe is always a list so that (Just 0) is distinct from
Nothing.  This is longer but more general.  If used to construct fully
generic algorithms, it might be needed.

```chialisp
(mod (p)
    
  (include *standard-cl-23*)
    
  (defun fromMaybe (v (@ m (content))) (if m content v))
  (defun mapMaybe (f (@ m (content))) (if m (list (a f (list content))) ()))
    
  (fromMaybe 0 (mapMaybe (lambda ((@ pt (x y))) (+ x y)) p))
  )
```
```shell
$ brun maybe.clvm '(((3 5)))' # Note: ((3 5)) is like (Some (Pt 3 5))
8
$ brun maybe.clvm '(())'
()
```

### Function closures

Chialisp allows function names to be treated as closures when used as values.
The resulting function is callable with the 'a' operator in the way other
foreign code would be when passed into your program or as a result of a lambda
expression.

```chialisp
(mod (Z)
   
  (include *standard-cl-23*)
    
  (defun add-one (X) (+ X 1))
    
  (defun map (F L)
    (if L
      (c (a F (list (f L))) (map F (r L)))
      ()
      )
    )
    
  (map add-one Z)
  )
```
```shell
$ brun map.clvm '((1 2 3))'
(a 3 4)
```

### lambda forms

Chialisp supports 'lambda' in a similar way to scheme.  The resulting value is
callable with the 'a' operator, has access to the program's functions and constants
and is in general safe to use for higher-order functions.

The above program could be re-stated as:

    (mod (Z)
   
      (include *standard-cl-23*)
    
      (defun map (F L)
        (if L
          (c (a F (list (f L))) (map F (r L)))
          ()
          )
        )
    
      (map (lambda (Y) (+ Y 1)) Z)
      )

### embed and compile include forms

Chialisp programs often need to know the hashes or contents of other programs
and other data and it can be inconvenient to translate it into chialisp source
code (especially if, during development it changes).

Chialisp now gives the ability to embed foreign data, including compiling
programs and embedding their compiled representation.  Since chialisp programs
contain identification about how they should be compiled, it's possible to
include programs from different versions of the language accurately.

```chialisp
(mod (Z)
    
  (include *standard-cl-23*)
    
  (embed-file hello-data bin "hello.txt")
    
  (sha256 hello-data Z)
  )
```
```shell
$ xxd hello.txt
00000000: 6865 6c6c 6f0a                           hello.
$ ./target/debug/brun embedhello.clvm '(world)'
0x26c60a61d01db5836ca70fefd44a6a016620413c8ef5f259a6c5612d4f79d3b8
$ ./target/debug/brun '(sha256 (q . 0x68656c6c6f0a) (q . world))'
0x26c60a61d01db5836ca70fefd44a6a016620413c8ef5f259a6c5612d4f79d3b8
```

### trace output via cldb

The cldb debugger now recognizes a specific clvm expression as indicating a
desire for diagnostic output.  One way to generate it is with a function like

```chialisp
  (defun print (l x) (i (all "$print$" l x) x x))
```

You can use this in your programs to determine what values have been computed
without stopping execution while the program runs:

```chialisp
(mod (X)
  (include *standard-cl-23*)
  
  (defun print (l x) (i (all "$print$" l x) x x))

  (defun C (N X) (if (> 2 (print (list "collatz" N) X)) N (let ((NP1 (+ N 1))) (if (logand 1 X) (C NP1 (+ 1 (* 3 X))) (C NP1 (/ X 2))))))
  
  (C 0 X)
  )
```
```shell
$ ./target/debug/cldb -p c.clsp '(3)'
---
- Print: ((collatz ()) 3)
- Print: ((collatz 1) 10)
- Print: ((collatz 2) 5)
- Print: ((collatz 3) 16)
- Print: ((collatz 4) 8)
- Print: ((collatz 5) 4)
- Print: ((collatz 6) 2)
- Print: ((collatz 7) 1)
- Final: "7"
  Final-Location: "c.clsp(6):50"
```

### defmac and full preprocessing

Preprocessing takes place separately from compilation in modern chialisp.  This
allows easier debugging of macros, allowing the user to view the preprocessor
output and check that generated code is correct, but also separating preprocessing
from CLVM and allowing a greater range of value distinction.  The preprocessor
is running code from the chialisp language, but it operates on values that include
programmer relevant distinctions such as "symbol", "string" and "number" as in
scheme.  The preprocessor can therefore both act differently based on what 
syntactic inputs its presented with and it can also preserve and pass on those
distinctions.  It's necessary to move the preprocessor out of a pure CLVM to be
able to surface errors about misspelled and unbound identifiers.

Chialisp can do a lot with macros.  Just two are builtin because they're useful
for building other macros, 'if' and 'list'.  I'll discuss these later in context
because they require knowing a bit about CLVM.

#### Example: 'and' macro

We can start with an example of a short-circuiting 'and' operator.  In other
versions of lisp and scheme, this operator lets you line up conditions that
depend on each other to keep from having runtime errors.

```chialisp
(mod (X)

  (include *standard-cl-23*)

  (defun and_ (CLAUSES)
    (if (r CLAUSES)
      (qq (if (unquote (f CLAUSES)) (unquote (and_ (r CLAUSES))) ()))
      (f CLAUSES)
      )
    )

  (defmac and CLAUSES (if CLAUSES (and_ CLAUSES) 1))

  (and X (r X) (f (r X)))
  )
```

This works nicely:

```shell
$ run strict-and.clsp > strict-and.clvm
$ brun strict-and.clvm '((1))'
()
$ brun strict-and.clvm '((1 2 3))'
2
```

We can check what this macro unrolls to:

```shell
$ run -E strict-and.clsp
(mod (X) (include *standard-cl-23*) (a (i X (com (a (i (r X) (com (f (r X))) (com ())) @)) (com ())) @))
```

We can format it nicely:

```chialisp
(mod (X)
  (include *standard-cl-23*)

  (a (i X
    (com
      (a (i (r X)
        (com (f (r X)))
        (com ())
        ) @)
      )
    (com ())
    ) @)
  )
```

Below I'll discuss what happened to 'if' (it's a macro itself in this language).
For now, you can think of (a (i X (com Y) (com Z)) @) as a weird way of saying
'(if X Y Z)'.

But what we can see here is:

- First the check of X
  - Then in the true case, a check of (r X)
    - Then in the true case, return (f (r X))
    - Else ()
  - Else ()

Which is just what we want for short-circuiting 'and' in a lisp like language.
Looking again at the central function of the 'and' macro:

```chialisp
  (defun and_ (CLAUSES)
    (if (r CLAUSES)
      (qq (if (unquote (f CLAUSES)) (unquote (and_ (r CLAUSES))) ()))
      (f CLAUSES)
      )
    )
```

One can see that the 'if' it expands to is:

  ```(if (unquote (f CLAUSES)) (unquote (and_ (r CLAUSES))) ())```

Which will cause code for the remaining and_ clauses to run if the first one
was truthy.  and_ is recursive so it'll make a left-heavy tree for any number
of checks we want to proceed the final result.  Each 'if' form emitted by and_
returns nil if its check was false, protecting the remaining ones from running.

We can break down how to develop chialisp macros.  Let's say we want to make 'or'
which returns the first truthy item from a set of input arguments.

We can start with a simple check:

```chialisp
(mod (X Y Z)
  (include *standard-cl-23*)

  (defmac or CLAUSES "hi from or")

  (or X Y Z)
  )
```

```shell
$ run -E or-test.clsp
(mod (X Y Z) (include *standard-cl-23*) "hi from or")
```

And expand on it:

```chialisp
(mod (X Y Z)
  (include *standard-cl-23*)

  (defun or_ (CLAUSES) "hi from or")

  (defmac or CLAUSES (if CLAUSES (or_ CLAUSES) ()))

  (c (or) (or X Y Z))
  )
```

```shell
$ run -E or-test.clsp
(mod (X Y Z) (include *standard-cl-23*) (c () "hi from or"))
```

Then decide how 'or' should work:

  - if there's one item left, then just return it.
  - if the first item is truthy, return it.
  - otherwise return (or ...) of the rest.

Note that CLAUSES is chialisp code the user put in the actual 'or' form, not
the results themselves.

The ```(qq ...)``` form is useful for writing what you'd write in chialisp and
having your macro produce that.  It quotes the code you write so that identifiers
pass through and are interpreted by the compiler after the macro is expanded.
The special 'unquote' form, causes whatever's inside it to be pasted into the
quoted code.  It makes for fairly understandable macros.

```chialisp
(mod (X Y Z)
  (include *standard-cl-23*)

  (defun or_ (CLAUSES)
    (if (r CLAUSES) ;; There are more.
      ;; Mistake: qq is missing.
      (if (unquote (f CLAUSES)) (unquote (f CLAUSES)) (unquote (or_ (r CLAUSES))))
      (f CLAUSES)
      )
    )

  (defmac or CLAUSES (if CLAUSES (or_ CLAUSES) ()))

  (or X Y Z)
  )
```

```shell
or-test1.clsp(7):12-or-test1.clsp(7):19: no such callable 'unquote'
```

So we fix that :-)

```chialisp
(mod (X Y Z)
  (include *standard-cl-23*)

  (defun or_ (CLAUSES)
    (if (r CLAUSES) ;; There are more.
      (qq (if (unquote (f CLAUSES)) (unquote (f CLAUSES)) (unquote (or_ (r CLAUSES)))))
      (f CLAUSES)
      )
    )

  (defmac or CLAUSES (if CLAUSES (or_ CLAUSES) ()))

  (or X Y Z)
  )
```

```shell
$ run -E or-test.clsp
(mod (X Y Z) (include *standard-cl-23*) (a (i X (com X) (com (a (i Y (com Y) (com Z)) @))) @))
```

So this output:

```chialisp
(mod (X Y Z)
  (include *standard-cl-23*)
  (a (i X
    (com X)
    (com (a (i Y
      (com Y)
      (com Z)
      ) @))
    ) @)
  )
```

If X is true then return X, otherwise if Y is true then return Y, else Z.

We can try it:

```shell
$ run or-test.clsp > or-test.clvm
$ $ brun or-test.clvm '(1 0 0)'
1
$ brun or-test.clvm '(0 3 7)'
3
$ brun or-test.clvm '(0 0 7)'
7
$ brun or-test.clvm '(0 0 0)'
()
```

These macros are used together in the ported rosetta code 'ABC' example later.

#### 'if' and 'list' macros

```chialisp
            (defmac if (A B C)
              (qq (a (i (unquote A) (com (unquote B)) (com (unquote C))) @))
              )
```

Which expands ```(if X Y Z)``` to 

```chialisp
(a (i X (com Y) (com Z)) @))
```

'com' is a special form in the chialisp compiler that outputs the code that
does what its argument does, in the context where it's expanded.  Because
chialisp's 'a' operator can run a CLVM value as code, this allows execution
to be passed down to one of two alternatives, based on whether X is truthy.
The 'i' operator returns one of its second or third argument based on the
truthiness of its first.

So the 'if' macro has turned a high level concept 'if' into something that,
with some language support, outputs chialisp that's completely made up of
primitive operators from CLVM.

The 'list' macro is similar:

```chialisp
            (defun __chia__compile-list (args)
              (if args
                (c 4 (c (f args) (c (__chia__compile-list (r args)) ())))
                ()
                )
              )

            (defmac list ARGS (__chia__compile-list ARGS))
```

Which expands ```(list X Y Z)``` to

```chialisp
(4 X (4 Y (4 Z ())))
```

Turning the list again into chialisp that uses CLVM operators in a more
primitive way.  This allows chialisp developers to turn high level ideas into
code that's frugal at the CLVM level.
